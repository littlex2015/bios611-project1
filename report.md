Looking at the Video Categories by frequency plot, we can see that Entertainment and music are the category that has the most trending videos. We can believe that there is a higher chance for music and entertainment become trending. Therefore, if a new youtuber wants to make a new trending video, he/she should probably make a video that is related to entertainment and music field.


However,another reason why entertainment has the most videos is that standard of the videos tagged as Entertainment is wider than the others,therefore, there might be more differences within this category than the others. In order to see the differnces inside each categories, let's draw the number of views per category.

It is obvious that all categories show a normal distribution, The views at some categories, such as gaming,education, travel and evenent are stables, which means that views in these categories tend to watch/ subscribe to the same channels and don't change their perefences very often. We can conclude that the entertainment and music have high potential growth while education and gaming have low potential growth. This leads to a suggestion that a new youtuber should create a channel related to music or entertainment.   


Next, Let's look at Like/Dislike ratio of videos in each categories to get a picture of the videos with the best public reception.

News & politics is the most disliked category based on the plot, followed by sports, auto/vehicles and entertainment. The wide ranges of boxplot in within these categories mean that the comments are controverted. In conclusion, Music seems to have the best public reception and if the youtuber is good at music-related skills. He/she should make a music video so that it can have the best change to become the next trending video, at the same time, they should aviod sports, auto/vehicles contents.


Every youtuber has a big dream that is having a video with over 2m views. Let's filter the dataset and only look at the videos with 2M views.

It is clear that Entertainment and Music have the largest potential to have the most views. Please note that a category having least videos with 2M views doesn't mean this category has the lowest performance. Categoty like Film&Animation perform really well but the number of video within this category is relatively. Therefore, if making entertainment or music video don't work for some youtubers, there're always other options.

Looking at plot of the time passes between published and trending, we can see videos never trend in the same day it is published, this makes sense because a trending video requires time to bediscovered before becomes a trending video. Most video trend a day after they get released.
