Proposal
Introduction
For better or worse, comic book super heroes occupy a central cultural role. Like most works of non-polemical fiction, and perhaps all the more true for what one might dismissively call low art, super hero comics draw on the collective unconscious and thus reflect an unfiltered view of contemporary cultural mores.

Can we see biases related to gender in datasets which cover super heroes, their powers and strengths and weaknesses? In what ways does gender manifest itself in these fundamentally freeform fictional characters.

This project will undertake descriptive statistics of several publicly available data sets. We will also look at naive bayesian models which try to predict super hero gender on the basis of their super powers. Finally, we will apply state of the art tree based regression to the same problem.

On the way we may do some clustering and a little machine learning.

Datasets
The datasets we undertake to analyze are publicly available on Kaggle and cover super hero powers and other personal information. They can be downloaded .

This repo will eventually contain an analysis of the Superhero Powers Dataset.
